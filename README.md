# Project Workflow Steps:

## 1. Data Collection: 
## 2.Data Exploration
## 3.Data preprocessing
## 4.Building Machine Learning Algorithms


# Retail Business Loss Project for The Kroger Co. (Data Science Intern)
 __Project Goal: Develop a data science model and predict factors contributing to shirk (loss) in kroger 
Stores, ultimately leading to improved inventory management and cost reduction.___

## Data Acquisition:
• Historical store-level data from Kroger, including:\
• Sales data (daily/weekly sales by product category)\
• Inventory data (stock levels, shrinkage rates)\
• Product information (price, category, perishability)\
• Store data (location, size, layout)\
• External data (local crime rates, weather patterns)

## Data Preprocessing:
• Clean and preprocess the data, engineer relevant features, and encode categorical variables.\
• Analyze shrink distribution across product categories, store locations, and timeframes.\

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
• Visualize trends in shrink data (e.g., heatmaps showing shrink by product category and store location).\
• Identify potential correlations between shrink and other variables (e.g., sales volume, weather conditions).\
• Segment stores based on shrink levels and analyze their characteristics to identify commonalities.

## Model Selection and Training:
• Explore various machine learning algorithms suitable for predicting shrink:\
• Use supervised (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and unsupervised (e.g., K-Means) models to predict shrink and identify store clusters with similar patterns.\
• Split data into training, validation, and testing sets, then train and evaluate models using MAE or Rsquared
• Fine-tune hyperparameters of the best model to optimize accuracy.

## Model Deployment and Evaluation:
• Deploy the chosen model(s) to identify stores at higher risk of shrink.\
• Develop visualizations and dashboards for store managers to easily understand predicted shrink rates and contributing factors.\
• Monitor the model's performance on a continuous basis and re-train it with new data periodically to maintain accuracy.
